# Research

Hotel management system plays a pivotal role in delivering hospitality to guests. It sets the stage for a pleasant or an unpleasant visit. Guests, often in an unfamiliar setting and wanting to proceed with their business or vacation plans, are eager to learn the who, what, when, where, and how of their new environment. Requests for information often begin with the porter, bellhop, front desk clerk, cashier, or concierge, because these employees are the most visible to the guest and are perceived to be the most knowledgeable. These employees are believed to have their finger on the pulse of the organization and the community. Their responses to guestsâ€™ requests for information on public transportation, location of hotel facilities, special events in the community, and the like indicate how well the hotel has prepared them for this important role. Front office managers must take an active part in gathering information that will be of interest to guests. They must also be active in developing procedures for the front office to disburse this information.
